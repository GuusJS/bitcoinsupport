title: Contribute to Decentral Support
---



We believe that a decentralized crowd can come up with better content than a company, much like Wikipedia is the best encyclopedia in the world because it is created by a million different people. We made it super simple to edit our content, you only need a GitHub account and know markdown.

If you don't have a Github account, you can create one here.
If you don't know about markdown, you can learn it in 5 minutes, here.
